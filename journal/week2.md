* Instrument Honeycomb for the frontend-application to observe network latency between frontend and backend[HARD]

* Add custom instrumentation to Honeycomb to add more attributes eg. UserId, Add a custom span

Think sth important for instrumentation

* Run custom queries in Honeycomb and save them later eg. Latency by UserID, Recent Traces

Save query by userid or recent tracers

## Week 2 notes

With the approach we used in docker compose of setting different service names for frontend and backend(which as far as I understand directs data to  different datasets within honeycomb)will we be able to produce a single trace containing combined latency between them? Can I combine results between datasets or will we have to tweak the approach?

### Instrument AWS X-Ray into backend flask application

Resources:

[AWS SDK for Python - xray section](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/xray.html)

[aws-xray-sdk github](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python)

### Configure and provision X-Ray daemon within docker-compose and send data back to X-Ray API



### Observe X-Ray traces within the AWS Consol

### Integrate Rollbar for Error Logging

### Trigger an error an observe an error with Rollbar

### Install WatchTower and write a custom logger to send application log data to CloudWatch Log group
